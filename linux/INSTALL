Installation
------------

1. Download the xal_phonetic file in this directory. You can click on the file, click on "raw," and save the file. You can also copy this entire /linux directory by running the following:

    $ git clone git@github.com:sjorcindy/xal-keyboards.git

2. Put the "xal_phonetic" file in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols by running the following:

    $ sudo cp xal_phonetic /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols 

3. Add a layout entry in the "evdev.xml" file in the /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules directory. Open the file with a text editor (you will most likely need the sudo command in front of the editor command). Search for </layoutList>, and insert the following layout block between the last </layout> and </layoutList>:

     <layout>
       <configItem>
         <name>xal_phonetic</name>
         <shortDescription>xal_phonetic</shortDescription>
         <description>Kalmyk (phonetic) </description>
         <languageList><iso639Id>xal</iso639Id></languageList>
       </configItem>
     </layout>

4. Save the file, exit the editor, and restart cinnamon by running the following:

    $ cinnamon --replace

5. Go back to your keyboard layout settings, and you should be able to find the layout under "Kalmyk (phonetic)" in the list.
